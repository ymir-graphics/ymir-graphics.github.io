#### What is the current development state?

At this moment we are still adding new features and ironing out any issues that may occur on the already added features.
So as you can guess it'll be some time until a public preview version will be made available.
However taking some time to make things properly is always good and will also give us a decent level of optimization.
For you this means better performance and visuals.

**For more detailed information about the update progress check our discord servers or the shaderlabs server.**
