### This is the first public alpha version of Ymir

This version is still early in development but we decided it's about time for a public alpha release to catch eventual bugs or incompatibilities.

#### Known Issues:

* a white edge may occur at the bottom of the screen in dark scenes
* intel compatibility is not yet confirmed and may also not be adressed

#### Not included effects:

* rough reflections
* cirrus clouds
* vps shadows
* various settings
* many other effects, but these are likely to be asked for
